Approach to task

Given the 1 hour timeframe, I decided to prioritize the following things:
1. Quickly set up document using my git jist and used a simple CSS-reset
2. Wrote out semantic HTML to establish the skeleton of the website
3. Optimized assets before uploading using tiny.png
4. Copy/pasted an existing hamburger code I have in my “code library” for speed
5. Executed a “first-run” of mock-up styles
6. Established a preliminary grid system without an external framework
7. Used a mobile-first approach to tackle responsiveness
8. Established some preliminary organization of stylesheet + general classes

Things I did not prioritize:
1. Web accessibility
2. Cross-browser and older browser considerations
3. Retina display
4. Comments in code
5. Tweaking some of the CSS to capture all the details of the mock-up (also, the hamburger menu needs tweaking too)
6. Font family, font sizing/ratio selection was not perfect (stylesheet would be helpful from designers)
7. I did not think too deeply about class naming/longevity of creating a design system (the grid system could be re-thought as well)
