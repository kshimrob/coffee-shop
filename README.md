Approach to task

I decided to prioritize the following things during the hour:
1. Quickly set up document using my git jist and used a simple CSS-reset
2. Used semantic HTML to create the skeleton of the website
3. Optimized assets before uploading using tiny.png
4. Copy/pasted an existing hamburger code I have in my personal “code library” for speed
5. Executed a “first-run” of CSS styling
6. Established a preliminary grid system without an external framework
7. Used a mobile-first approach for responsiveness
8. Applied some initial organization to stylesheet and reusable classes

Things I did not prioritize:
1. Web accessibility
2. Cross-browser and older browser considerations
3. Retina display
4. Code commenting
5. There is some tweaking that still needs to be done with styling (I see you, hamburger menu :P)
6. Font family, font sizing/ratio selection wasn't exact (design style guide needed)
7. Class naming could potentially be improved and did not address longevity of a design system (the grid system could be re-thought as well)
